        Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996. They consist
        of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist
        Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey.
        They met at University College London and began playing music together
        from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and then Starfish.

        After independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), the band
        signed with Parlophone in 1999. Their debut album, Parachutes (2000),
        included their breakthrough single "Yellow" and received a Brit Award
        for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music
        Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of
        Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included the
        singles "The Scientist" and "Clocks", with the latter winning a Grammy
        Award for Record of the Year. Troubled production of the band's third
        album, X&Y (2005), saw them explore new musical territory with their
        fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008); both
        were the best-selling albums of the year worldwide in 2005 and 2008
        respectively, topping the charts in over 30 countries. Viva la Vida also
        won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and the band's first Album of the
        Year nomination, while its title track became the first single by a
        British group to top the charts in both the United Kingdom and United
        States in the 21st century.

        Since then, Coldplay further diversified their sound with the subsequent
        releases Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams
        (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album
        presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's
        original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, funk,
        classical, jazz fusion, and progressive rock. They are also known for
        "euphoric" live performances, with critics stating are when the band
        "make the most sense". To celebrate their 20th anniversary in 2018, a
        career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was premiered at
        selected cinemas, featuring previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage.

        With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are the most successful
        band of the 21st century and one of the best-selling music acts of all
        time. According to Fuse, they are also the sixth-most awarded group in
        history. Other notable achievements include the sixth-highest-grossing
        tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums ever in the
        United Kingdom, the most number-one records in the country without ever
        missing the top, most nominations and wins for a band in Brit Awards
        history, and becoming the first British group to debut at number-one on
        the Billboard Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most
        influential bands of the 21st century as well, with Forbes describing
        them as the standard for the current alternative scene. The Rock and
        Roll Hall of Fame included A Rush of Blood to the Head on their "200
        Definitive Albums" list and the single "Yellow" is part of their "Songs
        That Shaped Rock and Roll" exhibition for being one of the most
        successful and important recordings in the industry. In spite of their
        popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing
        music icons.
